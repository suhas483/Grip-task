# Grip-task(The sparks foundation)

Project was about predicting the 
percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based on the number of hours they studied. This is a simple 
linear regression task. My role as a data science intern was to write a function to make the prediction of scores using 
the linear regression model. Technologies used in the above projects: Python, GitHub, Jupiter Notebook, 
Supervised ML (Linear Regression), Pandas, NumPy
